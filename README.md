## t-rex-runner-bot (using reinforcement learning)

Open smitpatwa.github.io/t-rex-runner-bot-using-RL and press space to see the bot learn!!
It will take some time for the bot to learn properly (above 15 minutes).

After learning, the bot will play exceptionally well. So it is worth waiting :p

All the code for the bot is in 'js/bot.js' file
